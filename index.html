                Thanuchaphond Aiemsaard, also called Kade. I was a Product Manager in Thailand who is particularly interested in Human centric design for digital products.

            <p>
                I have spent around 10 years of my work in the software development field. I had been a software developer for 6 years and then I turned myself to work in the IT management field.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have learnt from my experience that the key success of any products is, how it serves the “real” customer needs. And then, they would automatically be willing to use it. So that I decided to do a master degree of Interaction of Experience Design at
                <a href="https://www.ul.ie/">University of Limerick
                </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My ambition is trying to use these knowledge from this programme to uplift the health technology product which is my particular area of interest, in order to provide a better health quality to people.
