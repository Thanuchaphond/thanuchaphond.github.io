But in his dream, it looked so different, the house was dark and cold. While walking from his bedroom into the hallway he took in his surroundings, the atmosphere terrified him. As he walked onwards towards the stairs, he heard what sounded like <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> a young girl laughing. Scared, his breathing faltered, and he felt like he was suffocating. When he managed to control his breath he walked on further, until the voice of a young girl whispered in his ear, stopping him in his tracks. She asked him for help, he could not prevent himself from following that young girl's voice, dread began to set in. Suddenly, he heard a sharp noise behind him, and an ice-cold breath near his neck. His legs shook, he closed his eyes, but he could escape, not even within himself. The next sound was too close again. It beckoned him to open his eyes, he had to oblige. There stood a woman with her neck bent at an impossible angle. As soon as her black eyes saw him open his she began to scream. He ran as fast as his shaking legs would allow; his mind could not comprehend what was happening. He ran until he reached the stairs, that was where he fell…now his neck is also broken, his eyes black as coal.”</span><button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn" type="button" class="btn btn-link">Read more ></button></p>

                            <p class="text-justify" style="padding: 0em 0em 0em 2em;">Creating sound stories is a new skill for me, and in this work, I learned how to use free audio editing tools like audacity. And apply various techniques to create sounds from many free sound sources. I have learned how to choose a voice that matches the story I want to express. Sometimes, the original sounds might not be quite right for me, so I have applied the audio editing techniques from the class to help polish the sound in the way that I want.</p>

                            <p class="topic" style="color: #2D2A2A;"><img src="icon/create.png" width=5% alt="img" /> Improvement Area :</p>
                            <p class="text-justify" style="padding: 0em 0em 0em 2em;">In the story, there’s some missing sounds that I would express the clear story than this, It was the footsteps of men. I think this is an area of improvement in my work. And I will create more moments of anxiety, and a certain moment in the current voice may be more rhythmic. For example, moments of silence should be added to allow the listener to take root in what will happen next.</p>
